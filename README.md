## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the Smart Home Automation Project! This project, developed during the EMERTXE Internship, demonstrates how to build a fully automated home system using IoT technologies. The project utilizes Arduino, PicSimLab, and Blynk to create an environment where you can remotely control lights, temperature, and water levels.

## 🚀 Features

- **Garden Lights Control**: Automatically adjust garden lights based on ambient light using an LDR sensor.
- **Temperature Control**: Monitor and control home temperature using an LM35 sensor, heater, and cooler via Blynk.
- **Water Tank Management**: Manage water levels in a tank with inlet and outlet valves controlled through the Blynk app.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Arduino**: Microcontroller programming and hardware integration.
- **PicSimLab**: Virtual lab simulator for testing microcontroller circuits.
- **Blynk**: IoT mobile application for remote control and monitoring.
